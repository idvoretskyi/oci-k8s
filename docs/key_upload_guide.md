## Step 4: Verify Your API Key

1. The fingerprint of your uploaded key will be displayed in the API Keys list
2. Make sure this fingerprint matches the one in your `~/.oci/config` file
3. You can have multiple API keys, but make sure you're using the correct fingerprint in your config

## Step 5: Test Your Configuration

Run the following command to test your OCI CLI configuration:

```bash
oci iam region list
```

If this works, your API key is properly configured.

## Common Issues

### Too Many API Keys

If you get an error saying you have too many API keys, you'll need to delete an existing key:

1. In the API Keys section, find an old key you no longer need
2. Click the three dots menu (â‹®) next to it
3. Select "Delete"
4. Confirm the deletion
5. Try adding your new key again

### Fingerprint Mismatch

If you get authentication errors, verify that the fingerprint in your `~/.oci/config` file exactly matches the one shown in the OCI Console for your key.
